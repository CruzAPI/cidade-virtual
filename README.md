# Cidade Virtual Minecraft Server

**Cidade Virtual** is a unique Minecraft server plugin that offers an immersive city-building minigame, combining elements of resource management, strategy, and PvP combat.

## Key Features

- **City Minigame**: Players can create and manage their own cities, including essential structures like Town Halls, Generators, Deposits, Armories, and Defense Towers. These structures can be upgraded and repositioned within the city, offering a dynamic and engaging experience.

- **City Attacks and Defense**: Players can raid other cities to steal resources. If the city's owner is online, they can defend their city in PvP battles against the attacker, adding an exciting layer of strategy.

- **Additional Worlds**:
  - **Newbie World**: A beginner-friendly, infinite world with land protection for new players.
  - **Raid World**: A more challenging world with limited space, featuring trackers to encourage players to create hidden bases and raid others.

- **Item Rarity System**: Items are categorized into three rarities: **COMMON**, **RARE**, and **LEGENDARY**. Rare and legendary items can only be found in the Raid World, adding an element of risk and reward for players who venture there.
